### About Me (In a Hurry)
I'm a storyteller and designer that focuses on children's books that resonate with both children and adults. 

### About Me (Time to Spare)
I'm an illustrator and author working in graphite, marker, painting, and collage. Heartfelt moments and humor are my underlying themes throughout my work as a creator. I have over a decade of experience working with children as a Teaching Assistant and Daycare Provider. While working as a Teaching Assistant at the Cleveland Institute of Art, I further developes my passioin for children's literature. I was fortunate enough to become friends and connect with many of the children I was helping instruct. As I got to know each of the children they began sharing their stories and experiences on topics about loneliness, anxiety, and fitting in. My continued work on these types of stories has become a unique driving force for me in my work and has allowed me to develop designs that tell a sensitive and expressive story. 

### Jumping in the Middle
I'm starting this blog in the middle of a series I have been actively writing for 2 years now. The ideas for these stories have around and with me for around 5 years now. It has taken a multitude of life experiences and personal development to begin crafting the stories that I'm writing currently. As of today I have 2 of my 5 planned stories in a mostly 'complete' format. Those 2 stories are:

> ##### Fox: 
>
>

> ##### Duck: 

They are sketched out and in a dummy form. Those dummies currently sit in a classroom of 5th graders as they read and give feedback. While those are out and being critiqued I am deep into work on Book 3 and 4. Book 3 follows Rabbit, and Book 4 follows Bear. I'm leaving Book 5 as a little surprise. The story of Rabbit is currently in its 5th version and the current focus of the critique group. Bear's story is mostly an outline of events and ideas for the story and its structure.
